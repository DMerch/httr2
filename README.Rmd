httr2 is a ground up rewrite of httr with two main goals:

* Create a pipeable API that makes the request object explicit.

* Solve problems that were out of scope for httr but make writing API 
  wrappers a pain (e.g. rate-limiting, retries, non-standard oauth, ...)

## Major differences to httr

* HTTP errors are automatically converted into R errors. Use `req_error()`
  to override the defaults (which turn all 4xx and 5xx responses into errors),
  or to extract additional information about the error from the body of the 
  response.

* It's easy to automatically retry if the request fails or encounters a
  transient HTTP error (e.g. a 429 rate limit request). Use `req_retry()`
  to define maximum number of retries, and override the defaults that determine
  which errors are transient, and how long to wait before retrying.

## Installation

You can install the released version of httr2 from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("httr2")
```

And the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("r-lib/httr2")
```
