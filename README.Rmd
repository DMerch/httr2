httr2 is a ground up rewrite of httr with two main goals:

* Create a pipeable API that makes the request object explicit.

* Solve problems that were out of scope for httr but make writing API 
  wrappers a pain (e.g. rate-limiting, retries, non-standard oauth, ...)

## Installation

You can install the released version of httr2 from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("httr2")
```

And the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("r-lib/httr2")
```
